# Final project

You have to create a SPA with several pages in React, managing the common state with context, FLUX + reducers. The app must be responsive (mobile + desktop).

Minimum number of pages (views): Public API list, private API list and detail. Some of them have to be loaded via lazy loading.

The app will connect to an API of your choice and list the elements. In this list there must be pagination and also at least one filter. From this list you will have to create another list connected to a local API, where you will implement CRUD.

The interface must give feedback when an API response is expected, and it must also handle API errors.

We must use a user login that is reflected in the private API.

Requirements:

-   Design in Figma
-   List of components and responsibilities
-   Git Hooks and GitHub Actions
-   SonarCloud, minimum of one scan per day
-   Deployed to Netlify / Vercel
-   Semantic HTML (validated)
-   CSS with BEM/SASS
-   Testing with coverage.
-   Optimised (Lighthouse in Netlify / Vercel)
-   Authentication and private API using Firebase (BaaS)
